I am currently a postbaccalaureate fellow in the Health Equity and Decision Sciences (HEADS) Lab at the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities, a branch of the National Institutes of Health. My research focuses on simulating "virtual" clinical trials, as well as developing and validating clinical decision tools to support equitable breast cancer care. My advisor is [Dr. Jinani Jayasekera](https://irp.nih.gov/pi/jinani-jayasekera). 

Prior to coming to the NIH, I received my Master of Public Health degree in epidemiology/biostatistics from Washington University in St. Louis in 2023. I graduated from Southern Illinois University Edwardsville in 2021 with my Bachelor of Science degree in biological sciences. 

My goal is to pursue a PhD in the field of epidemiology or health services and outcomes research to continue my work in simulation modeling techniques to developing interventions, policies, and guidelines that reduce health disparities and social inequities in breast cancer care.
