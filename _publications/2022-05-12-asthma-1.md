Background 
While inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are considered the essential foundation of most asthma therapy, ICS inhaler nonadherence is a notoriously common problem and a significant cause of asthma-related morbidity. Partially acknowledging the problem of nonadherence, international organizations recently made paradigm-shifting recommendations that all patients with mild-to-moderate persistent asthma be considered for symptom-driven ICS-containing inhalers rather than relying on adherence to traditional maintenance ICS inhalers and symptom-driven short-acting beta-agonists (SABA). With this new approach, asthma patients are at least exposed to the important anti-inflammatory effects of ICS-containing inhalers when their symptom reliever inhaler is deployed due to acute symptoms.

Methods
This study will (Part 1) complete a pragmatic randomized controlled trial to evaluate if an inhaler strategy that utilizes symptom-driven ICS inhalers is particularly beneficial in maintenance ICS inhaler non-adherent asthma patients, and (Part 2) use a dissemination and implementation (D&I) science conceptual framework to better understand patients’ and providers’ views of inhaler nonadherence. This study, which will have an option of taking place entirely remotely, will use a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved electronic sensor (Hailie® sensor) to monitor inhaler adherence and includes semi-structured interviews guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR).

Discussion
This study is assessing the problem of nonadherence using a D&I implementation science research lens while testing a new inhaler approach to potentially ameliorate the detrimental consequences of maintenance inhaler nonadherence. We hypothesize that the use of a symptom-driven ICS/LABA management strategy, as compared to traditional maintenance ICS treatment and symptom-driven SABA, will lead to improved adherence to an asthma treatment strategy, decreased asthma-related morbidity, less cumulative ICS exposure, and greater patient satisfaction with an inhaler approach.
